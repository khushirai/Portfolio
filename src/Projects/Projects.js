            "Since these days, chat applications are growing in every field both at professional and personal level. Almost every companies uses chat applications like slack, in order to communicate with their employees. I have created a chat application as well using node.js and libraies such as socket.io which is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications that enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. In this application, user can create chat rooms and the users present in that chat room can communicate. It also features to send the live location of a person using Google Maps. Moreover, it keeps a track when a user enters the chat room and when the user exits the room. Also, a JavaScript filter 'bad-words' is used in order to warn the users and make sure that profanity doesnot exists in the chat room. Moreover, it has been made sure that a user that is not part of the chat room cannot send a message in that particular group.",

            "I have created a web application that shows the weather of any location as per the user's need. It is a simple project that uses gelocation and various other API's such as mapbox and darksky. I have used darksky API in order to obtain the latitude and longitude of the place that is entered by the user. It also throws respective errors in case it is not able to connect to weather service or if the location entered by user does not exist. Similarly, mapbox API is used to obtain the latitude and longitude of the address that is entered by the user and stores the value of latitude, longitude and location in order to obtain its current weather. It also throws respective errors in case it is not able to connect to location services probably when there is mismatch in the values of latitude, longitude. Also, if the place entered by user doesn't exist. Also, various concepts of Javascript are implemented in this project such as making http requests, callback chaining, destrcuting, building a JSON HTTP Endpoint. In  addition to this, deployment plays a vital role i.e the project is deployed to heroku as well as Github.  ",
